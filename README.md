# Blood Pressure Change Estimation from PPG Signals

This repository provides an end-to-end framework for preparing datasets and training machine learning models to estimate blood pressure (BP) changes from photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals. The data is derived from [VitalDB](https://vitaldb.net/) and [PulsDB](https://doi.org/10.3389/fdgth.2022.1090854), public vital sign databases.

The current release includes a small test dataset containing 20 subjects for demonstration purposes. Full datasets and complete codebase will be released progressively.

##  Overview

This project includes:

- MATLAB code to process PPG and BP waveforms into labeled training/testing samples.
- Balanced sampling based on systolic/diastolic/mean BP change magnitudes.
- Python modules for model training and evaluation.

ΔBP(i,j) = BP(i+j) - BP(i), i = [1, 2, 3,…, N-1], j = [1, 2, 3,…, N-i],
where,
- BP(i) is the initial blood pressure reading at time point i,
- BP(i+j) is a subsequent blood pressure reading j time points after i,
- ΔBP(i,j) represents the difference between these two readings.

The index i ranges from 1 to N-1, where N is the total number of BP readings for a patient.
This allows us to use any reading except the last one as our initial point. For each initial point i, j ranges from 1 to N-i enabling us to calculate BP changes for all possible subsequent readings. The upper limit N-i prevents accessing readings beyond the total number N.

Here is a concrete example: If a patient has 5 BP readings (N=5):
- when i=1: j can be 1,2,3,4 (comparing BP reading 1 with BP readings 2,3,4,5)
- when i=2: j can be 1,2,3 (comparing BP reading 2 with BP readings 3,4,5)
- when i=3: j can be 1,2 (comparing BP reading 3 with BP readings 4,5)
- when i=4: j can be 1 (comparing BP reading 4 with BP reading 5)

##  Requirements

### MATLAB
- R2021a or later (with HDF5 support)

### Python
- Python 3.8+
- `requirements.txt` will be provided for dependencies (e.g., numpy, torch, scikit-learn)

##  Usage

### 1. Prepare Data (MATLAB)
Place the following input files in the `data/` folder:
- `vitaldb.h5`
<!-- - `trn_ppgfea.h5` -->

Then run the preprocessing scripts:

```matlab
cd code/matlab
run('preprocess_bp_data.m')  % Generates training/test HDF5 files
